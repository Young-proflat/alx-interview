(0x08. Making Change)
=========================

Change comes from within
This project focuses on solving the "Making Change" problem using Python. The problem involves determining the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total, considering a pile of coins with different values.

Requirements
Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Execution Environment: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Python 3.4.3
File Endings: All files should end with a new line
Shebang: The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3
README: A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
Coding Style: Code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
Executable Files: All files must be executable
Tasks
Change comes from within Given a pile of coins of different values, the task is to determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total amount.
Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total) Return: Fewest number of coins needed to meet the total If total is 0 or less, return 0 If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1 coins is a list of coin values The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0 It can be assumed that you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list

Example
python Copy code makeChange([1, 2, 25], 37) # Output: 7 makeChange([1256, 54, 48, 16, 102], 1453) # Output: -1

Usage
To test the functionality of the makeChange function, you can use the provided 0-main.py script.
